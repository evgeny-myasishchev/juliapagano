  Hello! I am Julia.
</p>
<p>
  I am Ukrainian, married to Italian, living in St Andrews, Scotland with our three children. My first steps in photography started while at the university, when I was mostly capturing my travel memos with a simple film camera. When my first daughter was born, I got digital camera. Since then it only got worse - big camera, more lenses, some photography courses, and lots and lots of practice. Photography became my creative outlet, a way to preserve milestones and just moments, bits of everyday life, keep visual diary of my children growing, changing and discovering the world.
</p>
<p>
  When not photographing, I like to read, cook, bake, and enjoy outdoors with my kids. Take a <a href="/portfolio">look around</a> to see more of my work, and if it feels right - <a href="/contacts">do get in touch</a>. I'd be happy to capture your family, children and special moments for you to remember.
